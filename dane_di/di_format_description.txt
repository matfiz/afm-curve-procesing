\@1:Z limit: V [Sens. Zscan] (0.006713867 V/LSB) 55.00000 V
 [soft-scale] (hard-scale) hard-value
 
 hard-scale = hard-value/2^{number-of-bits}
 eg. number-of-bits=16 -> 2^16:
 hard-scale = hard-value/65536

V means Value - a parameter that contains a double and a unit of  measure, and some scaling definitions.  
C means Scale - a parameter that is simply a scaled version of another.  
S means Select - a parameter that describes some selection that has been made.
